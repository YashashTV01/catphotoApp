## HTML and CSS Explanation

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - The document begins with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, declaring the HTML5 document type.
   - The `<html>` tag contains the `lang` attribute to specify the language as English.
   - The `<head>` section includes the title of the page and links to external stylesheets or scripts. In this case, it only has the title.
   - The `<body>` tag contains the main content of the page.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - The CSS styles are embedded within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section.
   - `body` styling sets the font-family, margin, and padding to create a clean layout.
   - `main` styling ensures a maximum width of 800px and centering the content with margin and auto.
   - Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) are styled with a color of #333.
   - Anchor (`a`) styling includes color and removes the underline on hover.
   - `section` styling adds a margin at the bottom.
   - `img` styling ensures images are responsive.
   - Lists (`ul`, `ol`) have zero margin and padding, and list-style is set to none.
   - `fieldset` and `label` are styled for form elements.
   - Buttons (`button`) have background color and change color on hover.
   - `footer` styling includes a background color, padding, and center alignment. Links in the footer have a specific color.
